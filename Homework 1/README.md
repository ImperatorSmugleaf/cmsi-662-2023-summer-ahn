# Homework 1

This is a pair of python modules which implement and test a secure shopping cart system for an online storefront. The first module, cart.py, contains the implementation. The second module, cart_tests.py, contains tests which verify the security of cart.py. To run these files, first create a Python virtual environment and activate it. Then, use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the necessary modules to run the scripts. After that, you can use `python3 cart_tests.py` while inside the virtual environment to run the tests.
